Your are to use the summarization of a table to create new tasks with the following objective, which is delimeted by
triple backticks:
"""
{}
"""
Here's the summarization of this table, which is delimited by triple hashes:
###
{}
###

Let's think step by step.Based on the data summarization and objective, you need to return a list of tasks to be
completed in order to meet the objective. Return on task per line in your response. The result must be a numbered list
in the format:

#. First task
#. Second task

The number of each entry must be followed by a period. If your list is empty, write "There are no tasks to add at this time."
Unless your list is empty, do not include any headers before your numbered list or follow your numbered list with any other output.
